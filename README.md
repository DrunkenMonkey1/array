## Installation
`composer require minwork/array`
## What I need this library for?
Wide range of advanced associative array manipulation methods, smoother transforming array of objects and usefull shortcuts for most common array operations.

Here are some example cases that this library is usefull for:
- Group, filter, map or diff array of objects using their specific method called with supplied arguments  
- Flatten associative or single element array (including nested elements)
- Get or set multidimensional array element using its keys
- Filter or order array by its keys
- Check if array is truly associative, numeric, unique or array of arrays
- Get even or odd values

## How do I know how it works?
All of the methods are more or less self-explanatory and well documented making them easy to use with every IDE capable of viewing PHPDoc.
Just start with typing `Arr::` and you should figure out the rest.
Detailed documentation coming out really soon.

## What do I need to use it?
PHP 7.1+ - that's all! No unnecessary dependencies, just one simple static class.

## Is it tested?
Yes, it is currently used in live project and works like a charm. Automated tests coming soon.
